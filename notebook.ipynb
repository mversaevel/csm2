    "This section provides mean-variance spanning tests (Huberman and Kandel, 1988). This methodology has previously been applied in the context of international diversification. Mean-variance spanning works by selecting a set of initial asset, commonly called benchmark assets. Next to that, there are test assets. Mean-variance spanning provides an answer to the question of whether the mean-variance efficient frontier of the test assets is the same as that of the benchmark assets.\n",

    "# Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "This section explores the diversification properties of the CSM indices versus their traditional country proponents using Monte Carlo simulations. For both index types (csm and trad) we randomly sample countries to construct portfolios. For each simulation run, we vary the number of countries we draw. So we randomly draw 2 countries, 3 countries, 5 countries, etc. Each draw, we calculate the equal-weighted portfolio returns of the sampled countries and calculate annualized (geometric) return, standard deviation of the returns and risk/reward ratio (the ratio of the first two metrics - called the Sharpe ratio in the graph, although it is technically not so). This is repeated 10.000 times. We repeat this procedure for specific numbers of countries (2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16) and for both index types. We finally proceed to aggregate the results by retaining only specific points from the obtained distribution. For each set of outcomes of 10.000 runs we select only the 2.5 percentile, 97.5 percentile and the median observations. \n",

    "We can visually interpret these results as follows. Let's first look at the change in standard deviation as the number of countries in portfolio increases. We are not directly interested in absolute levels (these are slightly higher on average for CSM indices), we want to look at the shape of each graph and compare that. So this graph, for the CSM indices, starts at around 6.8% (for 2 countries) and ends at 5.9%. This is a decrease of 14%. For the trad indices, the curve starts at 6% (for 2 countries) and ends at 5.4%. This is a decrease of 10%. Moreover, the curve for the traditional country indices seems to be slightly more concave, meaning it approaches the asymptote faster. \n",

    "These results suggests that the diversification benefits of traditional country indices are depleted faster. It takes fewer different countries in the index to obtain a decrease in portfolio risk similar to holding all countries. A flipside of this observation is that one could say that these traditional country indices are more alike. For the CSM indices, it takes more countries to approximate the portfolio standard deviation of the full set of countries.
